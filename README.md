# Intro to HTML and CSS

## Requirements

We'll need two things for this lesson. A good text editor and Google Chrome. We're going to standardize the use of Google Chrome for this particular lesson thanks to something called [vendor prefixes](http://css-tricks.com/how-to-deal-with-vendor-prefixes/). However, if Google Chrome isn't your favorite browser, feel free to ask a mentor how you can make your project run in Firefox or other modern browsers.
